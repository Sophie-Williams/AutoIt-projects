# Fork

An attempt to bring the Unix operation Fork to AutoIt for the pursose of bringing MultiThread-ish functionality to AutoIt, as AutoIt does not support MultiThreading.

This is by far not the first project to offer a solution, nor is it the first dealing with emulating the Fork principle.

This solution do differ in important areas. They may be address specifically further in development. Currently differences is reflected in the code.
